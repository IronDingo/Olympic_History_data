Over this period, the number of events, participating nations, and artists grew somewhat irregularly. There was a jump in the number of nations and athletes participating in 1924, and perhaps in response to this increased participation, the number of events jumped up in 1928.

counts <- art %>% filter(Team != "Unknown") %>%

    Artists = length(unique(Name))
  )
