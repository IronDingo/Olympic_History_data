# Olympic history 

This repo contains scripts for scraping and analyzing historical data on all Olympic athletes from the 1896 Olympics through Rio 2016. This data was scraped from the soon-to-be defunct www.sports-reference.com. As explained in this [blog post](http://olympstats.com/2016/08/21/the-olymadmen-and-olympstats-and-sports-reference/) by the creators of the database, it will eventually become part of the IOC's Olympic Statistical Database. When that will happen and how much of that data will be publicly accessible is unclear. In the mean time, I'm glad I managed to scrape this dataset before the Olympic section of www.sports-reference.com disappears.
