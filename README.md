# Olympic history 

This repo contains scripts for scraping and analyzing historical data on all Olympic athletes from the 1896 Olympics through Rio 2016. This data was scraped from the soon-to-be defunct www.sports-reference.com. I wrote a series of blog posts analyzing this data, starting [here](https://rgriff23.github.io/2018/05/27/olympic-history-1-web-scraping.html).

I have also made this data available for download on Kaggle. As of September 2018, it has been downloaded over 10K times and is one of the most popular datasets on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results 

As explained in this [blog post](http://olympstats.com/2016/08/21/the-olymadmen-and-olympstats-and-sports-reference/) by the creators of the database, it will eventually become part of the IOC's Olympic Statistical Database. When that will happen and how much of that data will be publicly accessible is unclear. In the mean time, I'm glad I managed to scrape this dataset before the Olympic section of www.sports-reference.com disappears.
